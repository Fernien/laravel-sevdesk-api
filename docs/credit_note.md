# Credit notes

There are 5 different types for the tax type:
- [default] - Show sales tax
- [eu] - Tax-free intra-Community delivery (European Union)
- [noteu] - Tax liability of the recipient (outside the EU, e.g. Switzerland)
- [custom] - user-defined tax rate
- [ss] - not subject to VAT according to ยง19 1 UStG The tax rates are highly dependent on the tax type used.

You can also choose between 6 different credit note types:

- [RE] A normal credit memo that documents a simple sales transaction.
- [WKR] A credit memo that regularly creates normal credit memos with the same values in fixed periods (monthly, annually, ...).
- [SR] A credit memo that cancels another normal credit memo that has already been created.
- [MA] A credit note that is created when the end customer has not paid a normal credit note within a certain time frame.
  Often includes some kind of reminder fee.
- [TR] Part of a complete credit note. All partial invoices together make up the total invoice.
  Often used when the end customer can pay for items or services in part.
- [ER] The final invoice of all partial invoices that completes the credit note.
  Once the final invoice has been paid by the end customer, the sales process is complete.
