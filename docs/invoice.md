# Invoice

If you want to create invoices you need to set these configs:

```dotenv
SEVDESK_TAX_RATE=19
SEVDESK_TAX_TEXT="Vat 19%"
SEVDESK_TAX_TYPE=default
SEVDESK_CURRENCY=EUR
SEVDESK_INVOICE_TYPE=RE
```
These values are default values but please feel free to change this values.
For the tax type you can choose 5 different types:
- [default] - value added tax
- [eu] - tax-free intra-community supply (European Union)
- [noteu] - tax liability of the recipient (outside the EU, e.g. Switzerland)
- [custom] - using custom tax set
- [ss] - Not subject to VAT according to ยง19 1 UStG Tax rates are heavily connected to the tax type used.

Also you can choose between 6 different invoice types:

- [RE] A normal invoice which documents a simple selling process.
- [WKR] An invoice which generates normal invoices with the same values regularly in fixed time frames (every month, year, ...).
- [SR] An invoice which cancels another already created normal invoice.
- [MA] An invoice which gets created if the end-customer failed to pay a normal invoice in a given time frame.
  Often includes some kind of reminder fee.
- [TR] Part of a complete invoice. All part invoices together result in the complete invoice.
  Often used if the end-customer can partly pay for items or services.
- [ER] 	The final invoice of all part invoices which completes the invoice.
  After the final invoice is payed by the end-customer, the selling process is complete.
